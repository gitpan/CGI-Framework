Revision history for Perl module CGI::Framework

0.05
	- Fixed a bug that caused the framework not to call the pre_templatename and
	  validate_templatename subroutines if the non-OOP (function-based) approach using
	  the initialize_cgi_framework initializer was used, and the callbacks_namespace
	  parameter was not supplied.

0.04
	- Any methods and initializer parameters that were made up of 2 concatenated words
	  have now been separated by an underscore.  The following are affected:

	  Methods/Functions:
	  adderror		=>	add_error
	  clearsession	=> clear_session
	  showtemplate	=> show_template

	  Constructor/Initializer parameters:
	  callbacksnamespace	=>	callbacks_namespace
	  cookiename			=>	cookie_name
	  initialtemplate		=>	initial_template
	  sessionsdir			=>	sessions_dir
	  templatesdir			=>	templates_dir
	  validlanguages		=>	valid_languages

	  The old names will still be available for compatability-purposes however will be
	  phased out sometime in the future for code-cleanliness.  All existing and new
	  programs should use the new naming convention.

	- Implemented the ability to save session data in a mysql table instead of text files
	  through a new constructor parameter sessions_mysql_dbh.
	- Implemented a new method "remember" that is a shorthand for transferring values
	  from the just-submitted form to the session.
	- Changed default form enctype to "multipart/form-data" so that file-uploads can
	  be done.  This seems to have no side-effect other than enabling file uploads to
	  work.
	- Some documentation and synopsis bugfixes. - Thanks to Ron Savage <rons@deakin.edu.au>

	-  Added new methods: get_cgi_object, get_cgi_session_object, html_push, html_unshift
	-  Added new constructor option, importform
	-  Documentation fixes and elaborations

0.02
	-  Initial release
